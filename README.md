# someweireBot
An **online game** of **cryptographic puzzles solving** and **virtual treasure hunting**, playable on **Discord** (only available in **French**).

The game is set in a multiverse, composed of 3 worlds interconnected. In these worlds can be found a vital resource, called the Weive. 

The goal is to travel these worlds **virtually**, place by place, in the same way as in a **tabletop** game, using **bot commands**, and find **tokens** 
of the resource, hidden in the worlds. To obtain the tokens, the player has to solve **cryptographic puzzles**, encrypted using several famous **ciphers**.
